            "title": "Swift Beta performance: sorting arrays",
            "body": "<p>I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 1000000\nvar x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)\nfor i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = random()\n}\n// start clock here\nlet y = sort(x)\n// stop clock here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In C++, a similar operation takes <strong>0.06s</strong> on my computer.</p>\n\n<p>In Python, it takes <strong>0.6s</strong> (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).</p>\n\n<p>In Swift it takes <strong>6s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it takes as much as <strong>88s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Timings in Xcode with \"Release\" vs. \"Debug\" builds are similar.</p>\n\n<p>What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> weather noticed that changing <code>-O3</code> to <code>-Ofast</code> makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, <code>-Ofast</code> changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it <strong>disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows</strong>. For example, with <code>-Ofast</code> the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 10000000\nprint(n*n*n*n*n)\nlet x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)\nprint(x[n])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>-Ofast</code> is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got <code>-ftrapv</code> for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also \"harmless\" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)</p>\n\n<p>Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between <code>-O3</code> and <code>-Ofast</code>. So I had a look at the assembly code:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>With <code>-Ofast</code> I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.</p></li>\n<li><p>With <code>-O3</code> I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_retain\" and another 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_release\". That is, <strong>26 subroutine calls in the inner loop</strong>!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 10000\nvar x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)\nfor i in 0..&lt;n {\n    for j in 0..&lt;n {\n        x[i] = x[j]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>C++ -O3: <strong>0.05 s</strong></li>\n<li>C++ -O0: 0.4 s</li>\n<li>Java: <strong>0.2 s</strong></li>\n<li>Python with PyPy: 0.5 s</li>\n<li>Python: <strong>12 s</strong></li>\n<li>Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s</li>\n<li>Swift -O3: <strong>23 s</strong></li>\n<li>Swift -O0: 443 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. <code>x[i] ^= x[j]</code>, and add a print statement that outputs <code>x[0]</code>. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)</p>\n\n<p>And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be <strong>much</strong> slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.</p>\n\n<p>For sorting, I now have the following timings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clang++ -O3: 0.06 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -O: 0.1 s</li>\n<li>swiftc: 4 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For nested loops:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clang++ -O3: 0.06 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -O: 0.4 s</li>\n<li>swiftc: 540 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe <code>-Ofast</code> (a.k.a. <code>-Ounchecked</code>); plain <code>-O</code> produces equally good code.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>I'm trying to work out an appropriate singleton model for usage in Swift. So far, I've been able to get a non-thread safe model working as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class var sharedInstance: TPScopeManager {\n    get {\n        struct Static {\n            static var instance: TPScopeManager? = nil\n        }\n\n        if !Static.instance {\n            Static.instance = TPScopeManager()\n        }\n\n        return Static.instance!\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Wrapping the singleton instance in the Static struct should allow a single instance that doesn't collide with singleton instances without complex naming schemings, and it should make things fairly private. Obviously though, this model isn't thread-safe. So I tried to add <code>dispatch_once</code> to the whole thing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class var sharedInstance: TPScopeManager {\n    get {\n        struct Static {\n            static var instance: TPScopeManager? = nil\n            static var token: dispatch_once_t = 0\n        }\n\n        dispatch_once(Static.token) { Static.instance = TPScopeManager() }\n\n        return Static.instance!\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I get a compiler error on the <code>dispatch_once</code> line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type '()'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've tried several different variants of the syntax, but they all seem to have the same results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dispatch_once(Static.token, { Static.instance = TPScopeManager() })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is the proper usage of <code>dispatch_once</code> using Swift? I initially thought the problem was with the block due to the <code>()</code> in the error message, but the more I look at it, the more I think it may be a matter of getting the <code>dispatch_once_t</code> correctly defined.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>The character 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family with two women, one girl, and one boy) is encoded as such:</p>\n\n<p><code>U+1F469</code> <a href=\"http://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%91%A9/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>WOMAN</code></a>,<br>\n<code>‍U+200D</code> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ZWJ</code></a>,<br>\n<code>U+1F469</code> <code>WOMAN</code>,<br>\n<code>U+200D</code> <code>ZWJ</code>,<br>\n<code>U+1F467</code> <a href=\"http://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%91%A7/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>GIRL</code></a>,<br>\n<code>U+200D</code> <code>ZWJ</code>,<br>\n<code>U+1F466</code> <a href=\"http://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%91%A6/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>BOY</code></a></p>\n\n<p>So it's very interestingly-encoded; the perfect target for a unit test. However, Swift doesn't seem to know how to treat it. Here's what I mean:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\".contains(\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\") // true\n\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\".contains(\"👩\") // false\n\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\".contains(\"\\u{200D}\") // false\n\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\".contains(\"👧\") // false\n\"👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\".contains(\"👦\") // true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, Swift says it contains itself (good) and a boy (good!). But it then says it does not contain a woman, girl, or zero-width joiner. <strong>What's happening here? Why does Swift know it contains a boy but not a woman or girl?</strong> I could understand if it treated it as a single character and only recognized it containing itself, but the fact that it got one subcomponent and no others baffles me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This does not change if I use something like <code>\"👩\".characters.first!</code>.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Even more confounding is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let manual = \"\\u{1F469}\\u{200D}\\u{1F469}\\u{200D}\\u{1F467}\\u{200D}\\u{1F466}\"\nArray(manual.characters) // [\"👩‍\", \"👩‍\", \"👧‍\", \"👦\"]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though I placed the ZWJs in there, they aren't reflected in the character array. What followed was a little telling:</p>\n\n<pre><code>manual.contains(\"👩\") // false\nmanual.contains(\"👧\") // false\nmanual.contains(\"👦\") // true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I get the same behavior with the character array... which is supremely annoying, since I know what the array looks like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This also does not change if I use something like <code>\"👩\".characters.first!</code>.</strong></p>\n"

            "body": "<p>Fellow devs,\nI am having trouble with AutoLayout in Interface Builder (Xcode 5 / iOS 7).\nIt's very basic and important so I think everyone should know how this properly works. If this is a bug in Xcode, it is a critical one!</p>\n\n<p>So, whenever I have a view hierarchy such as this I run into trouble:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;UIViewController\n&gt;&gt; UIView\n&gt;&gt;&gt;UIScrollView\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UILabel (or any other comparable UIKit Element)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The UIScrollView has solid constraints, e.g., 50 px from every side (no problem).\nThen I add a Top Space constraint to the UILabel (no problem) (and I can even pin height / width of the label, changes nothing, but should be unneccessary due to the Label's intrinsic size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The trouble starts when I add a trailing constraint to the UILabel:</strong></p>\n\n<p>E.g., Trailing Space to: Superview Equals: 25</p>\n\n<p>Now two warnings occur - and I don't understand why:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity (Scroll View has ambiguous scrollable content height/width)</p>\n\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Misplaced Views (Label Expected: x= -67 Actual: x= 207</p>\n\n<p>I did this minimal example in a freshly new project which you can download and I attached a screenshot. As you can see, Interface Builder expects the Label to sit outside of the UIScrollView's boundary (the orange dashed rectangle). Updating the Label's frame with the Resolve Issues Tool moves it right there.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: If you replace the UIScrollView with a UIView, the behaviour is as expected (the Label's frame is correct and according to the constraint). So there seems to either be an issue with UIScrollView or I am missing out on something important.</p>\n\n<p>When I run the App without updating the Label's frame as suggested by IB it is positioned just fine, exactly where it's supposed to be and the UIScrollView is scrollable.\nIf I DO update the frame the Label is out of sight and the UIScrollView does not scroll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi! Why the ambiguous layout? Why the misplaced view?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can download the sample project here and try if you can figure out what's going on:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Wirsing84/AutoLayoutProblem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/Wirsing84/AutoLayoutProblem</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqoUh.png\" alt=\"Illustration of the problem in Interface Builder\"></p>\n"
